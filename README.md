# AVL Tree List
 The abstract data structure List - implemented by a Binary Search Tree with Python. 

 Binary trees and Lists are common and known data structures for every programmer. 
 In this mini-project, I've implemented the List ADT by a self balancing BT known as the AVL Tree. 
 This data structure is a BT that keeps its' height at O(log(n)) always by balancing itself after insertion and deletion of items,
 which gives us the advantage of logaritmic time for insertion, deletion and more !
 Because we want the list to be index like the lists we all know in python, the BST searches by indexes and not by keys, what makes 
 this list unsorted unlike what we would expect from a regular bst.
 Besides the code itself, there is a tester and full documentation in hebrew for the project, with interesting comparisons to a regular
 list implented by arrays and a list implemented by linked list, and some interesting insights ! 
 This is my first mini-project that I did through Data Structures course in the University.
